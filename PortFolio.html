                    <h3>Project 1: File encryption using JAVA</h3>

                    <p> This project is aimed at developing a desktop-based application named File encryption is the
                        process of converting a readable file into an unreadable format, which can only be accessed with
                        the appropriate decryption key. This is done to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized
                        access to it. File encryption can be used to protect files on a local device, in transit over a
                        network, or stored on a remote server. File encryption protects individual files or file systems
                        by encrypting them with a specific key, making them accessible only to the keyholder. The goal
                        is to prevent malicious or unauthorized parties from accessing files that are stored on the
                        disk. Support for file encryption can be built into an operating system or file system. A
                        decryption key allows access to the sensitive files. File encryption is helpful if a user needs
                        to send individual files securely over the internet or store them on a removable device such as
                        a USB stick. File encryption is an important security measure for protecting sensitive data from
                        unauthorized access. It is widely used in industries such as healthcare, finance, and
                        government, as well as by individuals who want to protect their personal data. There are many
                        different encryption techniques available, each with its own level of complexity and strength.
                        While encryption is a powerful tool for protecting sensitive data, it's important to remember
                        that no system is completely fool proof, and there is always a risk of vulnerabilities being
                        exploited.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2: Automatic short answer questions generation from text</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of this project is to develop an automatic system that generates short answer questions (SAQs) from a given text using Bloom's Taxonomy as a framework. Bloom's Taxonomy is a widely used classification system that categorizes learning objectives into different cognitive domains, such as knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. The system aims to assess students' understanding and critical thinking skills by generating questions that align with specific cognitive levels.</p>
